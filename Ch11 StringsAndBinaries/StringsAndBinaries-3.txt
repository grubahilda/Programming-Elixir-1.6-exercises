Exercise: StringsAndBinaries-3

Try the following in IEx:

​ 	​iex>​ [ ​'cat'​ | ​'dog'​ ]
​ 	['cat',100,111,103]

Why does IEx print ’cat’ as a string, but ’dog’ as individual numbers?

Response:
By using '|' notation, we suggest elixir that we divide the list into head|tail, so it takes the first argument as head element and the rest as a tail, which is just another list: in this case, a list of characters.
