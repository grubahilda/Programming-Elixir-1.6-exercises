# Programming Elixir 1.6 - exercises

Learning Elixir from the book *Programming Elixir 1.6* by Dave Thomas (version May 2018). In the Book, apart from basic syntax explanation, the author shows many examples and also challenges the reader to try coding on her own. I want to keep track on what I've learned and I created this repo for my future reference as well as sense of progress that I am making.
